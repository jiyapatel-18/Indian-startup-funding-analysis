# Indian-startup-funding-analysis
Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and visualization of Indian startup funding data using Python.

Indian Startup Funding Analysis 📊
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📌 Project Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------
This project analyzes funding received by Indian startups using Python.

The main purpose of this project is to clean the dataset, analyze startup funding patterns, and create visualizations to understand trends in the Indian startup ecosystem.

🎯 Objectives
------------------------------------------------------------------
 Clean the startup funding dataset
 Handle missing values
 Check and remove duplicate records
 Convert data into suitable data types
 Detect funding outliers
 Analyze startup industries and cities
 Analyze investment types
 Find the most funded startups
 Create meaningful visualizations
 Generate useful insights from the data

📂 Dataset
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The dataset used in this project is the Indian Startup Funding Dataset.

📂 Dataset – Indian Startup Funding(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/indian-startup-funding)

It contains information such as:

 Startup Name
 Industry Vertical
 SubVertical
 City Location
 Investors Name
 Investment Type
 Funding Amount
 Funding Date

🛠️ Technologies Used
-------------------------------------------------
 Python
 Pandas
 NumPy
 Matplotlib
 Seaborn
 Google Colab

🔍 Data Cleaning
------------------------------------------------------
The dataset was cleaned before analysis.

The following steps were performed:

 Checked the dataset structure and columns
 Identified missing values
 Filled missing categorical values with Unknown
 Checked duplicate records
 Converted dates into proper date format
 Extracted the year from the date
 Cleaned the funding amount column
 Converted funding amounts into numerical values
 Detected outliers using the IQR method

📊 Data Analysis & Visualizations
------------------------------------------------------------
The project includes visualizations such as:

 Total Startup Funding by Year
 Top 10 Startup Industries
 Top 10 Indian Cities by Number of Startups
 Top Investment Types
 Top 10 Most Funded Startups
 Top Industries by Total Funding
 Top Cities by Total Funding
 Funding Amount Distribution
 Normal Values vs Outliers
 These visualizations help us understand how startup funding is distributed across different years, industries, cities, and startups.

💡 Key Insights
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
From the analysis, we can understand that:

 Startup funding varies significantly across different years.
 Some industries receive much more funding than others.
 Major cities contribute a large portion of the startup ecosystem.
 A few startups receive very large amounts of funding.
 Funding data contains several high-value outliers.
 Investment types vary across startups.
 Startup funding is not evenly distributed.

📈 Outlier Detection
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Interquartile Range (IQR) method was used to identify unusually high or low funding values.

Outliers were not removed because large investments can represent genuine startup funding and may provide useful information for analysis.

✅ Conclusion
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project demonstrates the complete process of data analysis, starting from raw data cleaning and ending with meaningful insights.

Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn were used to clean, analyze, and visualize the Indian startup funding data.

The project helps us understand funding trends and the overall structure of the Indian startup ecosystem.
